# CitiBike-Project-One
Jon Morel Project 1 
Overview

Using my CitiBike data, I attempted to discover potential gaps in their bike rental business. The data I used comes from the Des Moines, New York CitiBike Data. In order to accomplish this task, I needed to identify the relevant information from the publicly available Citi Bike data that was applicable to Des Moines. I utilized the data from August 2019 for this purpose. With the data, I used Tableau to create visualizations from the data from the CitiBike data.

Findings

![CitiBIke Time Data Correct](https://github.com/morel120/CitiBike-Project-One/assets/151694307/e590f17b-8b6e-4bc1-be3e-362e06843eba)
Upon reviewing the data, it's evident that there's a notable surge in bike rentals during rush hours. To capitalize on this trend, I recommend exploring the possibility of introducing a slightly higher pricing tier specifically for these peak periods. By doing so, we may not only encourage more usage but also could potentially boost CitiBikeâ€™s profits. At the same time it is possible this will appeal to a wider range of customers. There could also be lower prices during non-peak hours which could hopefully increase sales outside of rush hour. It's crucial to align our marketing efforts with these insights, emphasizing the convenience and availability of bikes during busy rush hour times while making sure our marketing represents the affordability during off-peak periods and this would hopefully result in higher sales.

In looking at the data, it's clear that the main users of CitiBike are men, who use the bikes the most. On the other hand, women and users from other genders show less frequent usage. To maximize profit my suggestion is to adjust CitiBike's marketing approach. By making the marketing more appealing to women and other genders we can maxamize profits. This would help maximize profit while ensuring the company is more focused on inclusion and diversity.

Conclusion

In conclusion, my examination of CitiBike's data has revealed valuable insights that can be leveraged to optimize market performance. By strategically tapping into non-peak hours and tailoring our approach to include a more diverse audience, we have the potential to address existing market gaps. Recommending the introduction of varied pricing structures, such as potential discounts during off-peak hours and inclusive marketing strategies targeting women and other genders, aims to ensure a comprehensive and accessible service. I was able to answer the questions I sought out to answer and I believe I found these gaps in the market that would increase profit and inclusion.
